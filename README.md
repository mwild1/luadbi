LuaDBI is a database interface library for Lua. It is designed to 
provide a RDBMS agnostic API for handling database operations. 
LuaDBI also provides support for prepared statement handles, 
placeholders and bind parameters for all database operations.

Currently LuaDBI supports DB2, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite 
databases with native database drivers.

This version supports Lua 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.
